    <p>
      Hi folks. I'd like to welcome you to our brand new website. As much as
      it's basic it's also quick and easy to maintain while I focus hard at
      creating the very best websites and stuff for you guys at home. For those
      who don't know, I'm the owner of B2B Webmasters. A web development company
      based in Braintree, Essex. We have been trading only a few months and have
      already picked up a decent portfolio. Serving customers from all around
      Essex. As much as my ambition to work full time on this I simply cannot
      afford to at this stage. I work 40+ hours a week alongside the business. I
      am currently also in the process of setting up an office space in which I
      will be located.
    </p>
