Hi folks.

I'd like to welcome you to our brand new website. As much as it's basic it's also quick and easy to maintain while I focus hard at creating the very best websites and stuff for you guys at home.

For those who don't know, I'm the owner of B2B Webmasters. A web development company based in Braintree, Essex. We have been trading only a few months and have already picked up a decent portfolio. Serving customers from all around Essex.

As much as my ambition to work full time on this I simply cannot afford to at this stage. I work 40+ hours a week alongside the business. I am currently also in the process of setting up an office space in which I will be located.
<br>
<strong>
So what's my CV?
</strong>
<br>
I mostly work with HTML and CSS frameworks however I'm very intreasted in Javascript. I am exploring a new way of creating websites for more ease of use.

I can write code in HTML, CSS, and bits of JS. I did create a PHP website once for my old portfolio at College, however I have since moved away from server side and moved onto the front end. I have worked on many projects so far and all use diffreant systems. For example: the Braintree Town Supporters website is running WordPress, on the other hand this website isn't even using a CMS. So it really depends on the clients needs.
